## About!🧾

**Pokedex!** is a project made with pure JavaScript, HTML and CSS and the PokeAPI.
It's a simple API request sytem where you can get the name and the number of a Pokemon!

**About the searching system...**
</br>
As a simple exercise of an API request i've tried to make it simple as possible; when you press enter to search a pokemon, the system just throw a new request on the api with the name or number desired.

**About the request and error handling message!**
</br>

Once the request has been made(with fetch), if the response is "ok", the name and number of the pokemon is displayed, if not, an error is thrown and the *"missigno"* image is displayed
*(missigno is a bug with pokemons rendering in the original games :D)*
